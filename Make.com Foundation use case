This Make.com Foundation use case scenario automates weather-based data logging into Google Sheets:

It starts by retrieving the current weather using the Weather module.

A Router then checks the temperature:
If it’s above 20°C, it logs the data in one Google Sheet.
If it’s below or equal to 20°C, it sends the data to a different Google Sheet.

This demonstrates conditional routing, data logging, and real-time automation based on external API data.
